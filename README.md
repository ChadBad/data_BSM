SWBF3 mod for SWBF2

Our aim is to create a mod for SWBF2 that contains most of the cancled SWBF3 assets. We will make a
side mod and recreate the SBWF3 maps. Since now we only plan to recreate Coruscant.

If you want to join our team, contact me (Anakin) or thelegent on www.gametoast.com. You may need a 
web proxy depending on your country.

ONLY ADD WHAT YOU NEED!! Do not copy a whole folder from the stock assets, if you don't need every file
from it.
