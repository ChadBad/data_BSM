# Star Wars Battlefront III Project

This project is about porting parts from the cancled Free Radical SBWF3 to good old SWBF2.  
We will not do it 100% the same but we will try to use as many extracted assets for the  
sides as possible. Furthermore we will rebuild the SWBF3 Coruscant map.

#### Our Team
